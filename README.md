# HorizonZeroDawnCheat
A sample HP modifier

It's not really a cheat but it can help if you fight bosses that do a lot of damage.
I do not automatically retrieve the HP memory address, do it with cheat engine or something else

Compile the program with your favorite compilator (like g++, clang...)
I do not promote cheating, only learning
